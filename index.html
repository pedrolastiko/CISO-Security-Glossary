Rather than applying static authentication policies, this approach evaluates multiple signals including user behavior, device posture, location, network, time of access, and requested resource sensitivity to calculate a real-time risk score. Low-risk scenarios might require only primary credentials, while high-risk situations trigger additional authentication factors, step-up challenges, or access denial. Machine learning models continuously refine risk assessments based on evolving patterns and threat intelligence. This intelligent approach reduces friction for legitimate users while strengthening defenses against account takeover, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access attempts.

This proactive security practice evaluates AI models against various attack vectors including adversarial examples designed to cause misclassification, prompt injection attacks to manipulate model behavior, data poisoning to corrupt training sets, model inversion to extract sensitive training data, and membership inference attacks. Red team exercises explore edge cases, test safety guardrails, identify biases that could lead to discriminatory outcomes, and validate model robustness under adversarial conditions. Organizations developing or deploying AI systems must establish red teaming programs that combine automated testing tools with human creativity to discover novel attack vectors.

ABAC policies evaluate multiple attributes such as user department, clearance level, data classification, time of day, location, and device security posture to make dynamic access decisions. This approach offers superior flexibility and precision compared to traditional role-based access control, especially in complex environments with diverse access requirements. ABAC enables organizations to implement sophisticated policies like allowing access to confidential documents only during business hours from approved devices within corporate networks. The model supports regulatory requirements for least privilege access, segregation of duties, and context-aware security.

Passkeys implementing FIDO2 standards provide this capability with excellent user experience—users authenticate through biometrics or PINs locally on their device, with no passwords to remember or phish. This approach prevents credential phishing, eliminates password reuse risks, provides strong multi-factor authentication, and improves user experience through passwordless flows. Organizations adopting device-bound authentication must manage device registration, provide backup authentication methods for device loss, and ensure support across applications.
